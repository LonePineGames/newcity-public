Gameplay Basics: The Zones

![The Zone Tool](docs/images/zone_tool.png)

Cities are built on zones. While the mayor won't be swinging a hammer themselves, proper planning and placement of the different zones facilitate the construction of neighborhoods, shopping centers, industrial areas, and more. 

##### Placing Zones and Brushes
* When roads are built lots are generated alongside them. Each lot can be assigned a particular zone type, from Residential (![](IconZoneResidential)) to Retail (![](IconZoneRetail)), Agriculture (![](IconZoneFarm))to Industry (![](IconZoneFactory)). Even Office (![](IconZoneOffice)) and Mixed Use (![](IconZoneMixedUse)) zoning can be applied in established cities. Once zones have been established citizens can begin constructing buildings on the lots. The zone type restricts the sort of designs that can crop up there. For instance, Residential allows for homes and apartment complexes, while Retail allows for stores, shopping centers, and malls.
* The default zone type is unassigned, or Dezoned (![](IconZoneNone)). Lots can be Dezoned to prevent new construction on the lots. Note that existing buildings will not be demolished when Dezoning lots. 
* Use the brushes, located along the top of the Zone Tool, to change how you assign zones. Use the Edge brush (![](IconVerticalBar)) to assign zones along stretches of road, or use the Radius brushes (![](IconDotMedium)) to paint zones.  

##### Density and Overzoning
* Each lot has an assigned maximum density that defaults to 10. If you want to keep parts of your city rural or suburban, you can change the maximum density for building designs on the lot prior to zoning via the Density Control slider (![](IconApartment)). 
* You can zone over existing zones with other zone types or maximum density thresholds if the Overzone toggle (![](IconOverzone)) is enabled. Otherwise, you can only assign zone types to Dezoned lots. 

##### Zone Demand
* Zone demand is complex and involves a multitude of factors. Open the Info Panel (![](IconI)) and select the different zone types to see what factors are affecting demand. 
* Note that zone demand is not satisfied simply by placing zones of that type. Rather, demand will be affected when new buildings are constructed and the zone is "used," or when the factors underlying demand change. Sometimes the best approach to demand isn't to create new zones of that type, but to make existing undeveloped zones more attractive for development. 

Note: Certain zones, like Mixed Use, Industry, and Office, require a minimum amount of density to begin development. These are ideal for established cities with growing urban centers.
