Fun on the Autobahn 4/10

Before we go on building our freeway -- which is totally rad by the way -- I gotta tell you about this awesome tool NewCity has. Click that secretive little ![](IconCheck)Checkmark in the bottom right corner of the Road Tool.

That's right. It's _PLANNER MODE_. This lets you build the whole highway in Virtual Reality man. You don't have to pay for anything until you got your freeway just right. And it'll remember your plans when you save and reload the game.

When you got your roads just where you want them, click ![](IconYes)Complete All for Whatever and you'll buy the plan! It really comes in handly.
