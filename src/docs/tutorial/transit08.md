The Transit Way 9/15

Like we said before, you have two options to avoid destroying your beautiful downtown:
1. Up (Elevated Rails)
2. Down (Subways)

If you want to build up, click ![](IconUp)Raise [Q] once. This will raise the elevation of the train tracks 4 meters (or 12 feet) above the city roads, allowing you to build a track that straddles the street, like Chicago's famous 'L' system.

If you want to build down, click ![](IconDown)Lower [Z] once. This will lower the elevation of the rails 4 meters (12 feet) underground, allowing you to avoid buildings and surface infrastructure entirely. Note: this option is much more expensive.
