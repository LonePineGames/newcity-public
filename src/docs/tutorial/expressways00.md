Fun on the Autobahn 1/10

You had two choices for advanced transportation in your city -- cars and mass transit -- and you chose cars. Radical choice dude! Who wants to wait for the bus to pick them up? Nothing beats the comfort and convenience of the private automobile.

People want to drive fast, and they don't want to wait for red lights. Expressways are high speed roads without intersections, allowing cars to travel unimpeded at 100km/h or 60mph (or faster). Expressways must be grade-separated from other roads, so you'll want to build them one level above or below the surface. We'll go over how to do that.

To start, open the Transporation Tool [2] and select Expressways [X].

(By the way I hope you don't mind if I call you "dude", man. I know there's ladies out there that play NewCity too. I just call everyone dude, man. It's who I am.)
