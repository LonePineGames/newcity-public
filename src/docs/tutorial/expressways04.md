Fun on the Autobahn 5/10

Let's add some exits to this highway. Hold down shift when connecting to a surface road at a different elevation.

![This simple little pattern is called a "Diamond Interchange". See how there's three lanes leading into it, but it narrows down to two lanes over the bridge? Mixing up the lanes like that just makes everything flow better, man.](docs/images/tutorial/expressways/expressways-4-a[6].png)

Hey, don't put those exits too close together. Then everyone has to merge in and out -- it just clogs things up.
