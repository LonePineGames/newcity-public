The Transit Way 12/15

Now you have a track -- let's get some trains on it! Press ![](IconRoute)Lines [V] to go back to the Transit View. Once the rail is placed, making train lines is just like making bus lines. Press ![](IconAddTransitLine)Add Transit Line [F] to create the first line. Then place a stop on every Station Platform in order. Remember to backtrack so that the train goes both directions.

Did you forget to put a station somewhere? Just go back to ![](IconRail2)Build [B] and build a Station Platform *over* the section of track, at the same elevation. Or, you can double click on a section of track to turn it into a platform.

By the way, you can connect NewTrack to your neighbors, just like you can connect to them with roads. Every neighboring city has stations, so you can extend the line right to their city centers. Tourists love this!
