Fun on the Autobahn 8/10

This city is so cool, it needs more than one freeway. Let's build another!

But how do we connect the expressways where they meet up? Well you gotta build the ultimate connector -- THE FULL STACK INTERCHANGE. Make sure that every road approaching the interchange is connected with every road leading away from it. If you got two highways criss-crossing, then there will be 12 whole ramps!
