Knowledge Workers 1/12

In NewCity, there are four types of business: Farms, Factories, Retail, and Offices. These businesses will only be attracted to your city if there are enough workers with the right level of education: High School Diplomas for Factories, Bachelor's Degrees and PhDs for Offices, and No Education for Retail and Farms.

Educated citizens also commit less Crime, create more Prosperity, and spend more money at the store -- leading to higher Sales Tax income. These are just some of the benefits of education. So how do you raise the knowledge level of your city?
