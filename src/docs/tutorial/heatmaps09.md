Heat and Density 10/11

### Infoviews

Infoviews are not Heatmaps, but they display other information about your city.

#### ![](IconHouse)Zone Infoview

Sometimes, you just want to see the zones. The Zone Infoview (![](IconHouse)) dissolves your city (visually only, of course) into the roads and the lots connected to them.

##### Purpose
Enable the Zone Infoview (![](IconHouse)) to see only your road infrastructure and associated lots. Lots will be colored according to any zoning already applied, including dezoned lots. They will also show their assigned maximum density by the height of the lot stack. 

#### ![](IconRoad)Roadmap Infoview

Sometimes the real obstacle to a mayor's forethought is "too much information." Cut out the clutter with the Roadmap Infoview (![](IconRoad)) and get to planning your city's future.

##### Purpose
Use the Roadmap Infoview (![](IconRoad)) to sweep anything that isn't road-related off the proverbial table. Only roads, expressways (highlighted in yellow), railways, amenities, and the faint shadows of vehicles on the road will remain, set against a gray background. The Roadmap Infoview (![](IconRoad)) is best used to plan changes to dense city centers, peering through the skyscrapers to see the circulatory system of roads at their roots. 

#### ![](IconCar)Traffic Infoview

Looking to keep a pulse on the ebb and flow of your cities? Use the Traffic Infoview (![](IconCar)) to monitor the volume of vehicles moving through your streets in real-time.

##### Purpose
With the Traffic Infoview (![](IconCar)) active, your city will be shrouded in shadow and vehicles will be highlighted by their headlights. As more vehicles congregate on stretches of road, those segments will brighten to indicate the increase in average traffic. Find the brightest spots in your city and you'll find the bottlenecks that a savvy city planner can eliminate with thoughtful infrastructure improvements.

#### ![](IconBus)Transit Infoview

As your city grows, the wise mayor will employ mass transit to minimize vehicles on the road and maximize traffic efficiency and profits. The Transit Infoview (![](IconBus)), like the ![](IconRoad) [[infoviews/ivRoadmap|Roadmap Infoview]], trims down the presentation to the bare fundamentals you need for managing your transit system.

(If you haven't built out your transit system, there won't be much to see in this view.)

##### Purpose
Use the Transit Infoview (![](IconBus)) to focus in on all the building blocks of your mass transit system, transit lines, stops, and vehicles you have established. Transit lines will show up as the color specified by you in the Transit Designer. You can see passenger numbers at a glance, as well as the transit vehicles currently on the route. 

#### ![](IconUnderground)Underground Infoview

Wondering what's going on beneath the surface of your city? Check out the subterranean happenings with the Underground Infoview (![](IconUnderground)).

![](docs/images/tutorial/heatmaps/heatmaps-0.png)

##### Purpose
The Underground Infoview (![](IconUnderground)) renders only the roads, expressways, railways, and amenities of your city. The surface level terrain is made transparent, so as to reveal any of the former three which may have been constructed underground with "Build Tunnels" (![](IconUnderground)) enabled.
