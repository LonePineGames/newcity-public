Fun on the Autobahn 3/10

If the highway is gonna cross a road, just go over it -- or under it. Use ![](IconUp)Raise [Q] and ![](IconDown)Lower [Z] to change the elevation of the expressway. If you go down, engineers (like those guys with literal pocket protectors, man) will dig a big trench for your freeway. If you go up, the engineering dudes will build a mound of dirt under the road. Awesome!

Changing the elevation does cost a bit more. But not nearly as much as trains. Highways are definitely cheaper -- and way more fun!
