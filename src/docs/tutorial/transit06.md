Decide where you'll place your first railroad. You probably want to run a line through downtown -- that's a great idea! But you probably don't want to rip up all the big buildings that have grown there. You can avoid that by building either elevated rails or subways. We'll go over them in a minute.

For now, find a place along your planned route that doesn't have too many buildings. Don't worry about evicting a few homeowners -- the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
