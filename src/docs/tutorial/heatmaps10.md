Heatmaps and Infoviews let you peel back the layers of the city so you can see what lies underneath. But once you have the data, you want to find out how to change things. What's the easiest way to have a direct impact on the various heatmaps? The answer: Amenities.

Almost every Amenity gives bonuses to one or more heatmaps. For example, every amenity with a +1![](IconTree)Nature will reduce the ![](IconPollution)Pollution in the area around where it's built, like a magic vacuum cleaner. Figure out which heatmaps need improving, and build amenities that target those heatmaps.
