Knowledge Workers 11/

Click on the ![](IconLeft) arrow to go back to the menu, then scroll up and select "Unemployed with a Bachelor's Degree". These are the people who could fill these positions. If that number is very small, or zero, then you need to educate more people.

In that case, check out the tutorials on Expressways and Mass Transit to find out how to move people around the city more efficiently.
