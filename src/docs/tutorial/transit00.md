The Transit Way 1/15

You had two choices for advanced transportation in your city -- expressways and mass transit -- and you chose transit. A wise and principled choice! Compared to car-dependant cities, cities with mass transit have less Traffic, less Pollution, achieve Density faster, and even have better Community, since people meet and mingle in train cars and platforms.

The trick with transit, of course, is coverage. Your transit system will not be effective unless it's an expansive system which covers your citizens' homes and destinations. The best strategy is to build one or a few major train lines connecting your city center with the 'burbs, and lots of bus lines to cover the vast residential areas. We'll go over buses first, and then you'll build your first train line.

To start, open the Transportation Tool [2] and select Buses [R].
