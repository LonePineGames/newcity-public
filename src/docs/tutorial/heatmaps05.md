### ![](IconLandValue)Value

What are buildings and land in your city limits worth? The Value Heatmap (![](IconLandValue)) allows you to see at-a-glance where your city planning efforts and policies are producing valuable results.

##### Affects:
* Property tax income - Nicer buildings are worth more, and their owners pay more in taxes.
* How nice your city looks
* Achievement unlocks - Some achievements require high value buildings to unlock. For example, the Zoo requires a mansion: a Residential building of Value 10, the highest possible value.

##### Affected By:
* Increased by [[heatmaps/hmEducation|Education]]
* Increased by [[tools/toolAmenity|Amenities]] - Recreation
* Increased by Park Zones
* Increased by Elevation, proportionally to the height of the terrain - Higher elevation increases Value
* Increased by proximity to water - Closer to water increases Value
* Reduced by [[heatmaps/hmPollution|Pollution]]
* Reduced by vehicles - Minor reduction from cars, moderate reduction from trucks
