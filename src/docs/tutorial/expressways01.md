Fun on the Autobahn 2/10

You can build Expressways just like you build ordinary roads. But there are a few differences:

1. Expressways cannot be zoned, and buildings will not be built along side them.
> (Living near the highway is great man, but I don't want my driveway there.)
2. Each Expressway segment is One-Way. To build a "dual carriageway" (a highway in both directions) you'll need to build two segments side-by-side.
> (You know, after I go shopping, I gotta get back home! Makes sense, right?)
3. Expressways cannot have Intersections, only Junctions. Junctions may only have 3 "legs" (connecting roads), and must join at a small angle, less than 45 degrees.
> (Dude I was driving in this one city and no joke -- they had a FULL 90 DEGREE swerve from the on-ramp going onto the highway. I almost hit this old lady in a stationwagon, it was terrible. So we're not doing that in our city.)

So start by building that dual carriageway, dude. You know the drill: left click to start, left click to build it, right click when you're done.
