The Transit Way 10/15

Whether you choose to go up or down, click ![](IconCauseway)Viaduct [H] or ![](IconUnderground)Tunnel [H]. These two buttons instruct your engineers to use viaducts or tunnels instead of earthworks. When building down, they'll build a tunnel (or subway). When building up, they'll build a viaduct, which is a type of bridge.

If you choose to build down, you will see an underground view, making it easier to place subways.
