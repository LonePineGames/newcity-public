Fun on the Autobahn 6/10

Okay, so what if you have bit of water you gotta build a bridge across? I'll show you how to build that real fast.

(If your city ain't got any water, or there's no cool places for a bridge, you can skip this step. [[Tutorial::Expressways06|Just click here dude.]])

Okay so open up the ![](IconTrussBridgePillar)Pillar Tool [N]. All the water will hide itself so you can see the sea floor. See how some areas are deeper than others? It costs more to build a bridge where the water is real deep.

You gotta place a chain of pillars so it crosses the water. Every pillar needs to be within the big circle of the next pillar, that's the max length the engineers can build a span. If you need a longer span, try out a ![](IconSuspensionBridgePillar)Suspension Bridge [Z]. It's twice as long!

Then you gotta build a road across. You can put a Boulevard... or an Expressway of course, but then you gotta build twice the pillars for the backwards direction too. You could even put a train track over the pillars -- if you're into that sorta thing. I think trains are boring.
