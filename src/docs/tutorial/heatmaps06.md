Heat and Density 7/11

### ![](IconDensity)Density

Density (![](IconDensity)) is the objective of NewCity. Invite your citizens to build upward instead of outward, manifesting the wealth and prestige of your city in spires of glass and steel that reach toward the heavens. 

Residential Density is limited by your Prestige score. Build amenities that increase your prestige to get those high rise condos!
