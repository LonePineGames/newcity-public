The Transit Way 11/15

Now go ahead and build your downtown line. For your first segment of elevated rail/subway, hold down shift while you left click on the end of the surface level tracks you built before. This will create a ramp up or down to the new elevation.

If you chose elevated rail, make sure to place each segment over a roadway (so you don't destroy buildings in the way). Watch out for spurious ![](IconT)Intersections with the road below -- Click ![](IconUp)Raise [Q] a second time if you need to.

If you chose the subway route, congrats! You can build pretty much anywhere you want -- except too close to water. (It's hard to build a tunnel in wet dirt.)
