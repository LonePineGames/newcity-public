(Not So) Fun on the Autobahn 10/Whatever

Yeah, so traffic's no fun man. Maybe highways alone can't really cut it. Building more roads just makes people want to drive MORE creating MORE traffic! Aarg!

Maybe you wanna give this trains thing a shot. I don't blame you.

Just don't break the bank buying trains, man. I voted for my tax dollars to go to the freeway, and frankly I still love it. But at least when there's a train it cuts down on the traffic, so I can drive fast again.

Anyway the highway is still important for trucks and stuff cause when you're hauling cargo you gotta use a truck. And that's how we eat man -- trucks.

Okay, that's all I got. It's been fun dude, peace out.
