The Transit Way 13/15

Before we finish up with this transit tutorial, let's optimize for ridership. You probably spent a lot of money on your wonderful mass transit system, and at first it might not seem like very many people are taking the train. What gives?

Open the ![](IconQuery)Query Tool [1] and select the ![](IconRoute)Route Inspector [R]. The Route Inspector shows how citizens choose to make trips -- by car or transit.

Left click on a house near a bus stop. This will pin the red cone, and a blue cone will appear. Hover the blue cone over downtown near a train station, and left click again to pin it. If your transit system is properly connected, you will see a transit route. You will also see a red line, which represents the equivalent trip by car.

In bottom left, you can see the factors that go into a citizen's decision to choose train over car. Citizens care about time and cost. If both car and transit routes are possible, ![](IconYes)Preferred shows which one the citizen will choose.
