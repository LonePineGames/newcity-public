The Transit Way 15/15

Go back to the ![](IconQuery)![](IconRoute)Route Inspector [1>R] and test the same route. How did your changes affect the decision to take car or transit? 

Notice that mass transit will not be effective unless the complete system has coverage of both homes and destinations. You'll need a lot more bus lines -- and maybe another stretch of rail -- before it'll have a meaningful impact on traffic.

So how do like your new train? More importantly, can you afford it? You can always bail out now and go for Expressways instead.

But you wouldn't do that. Mass Transit is the right choice.
