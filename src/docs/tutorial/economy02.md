Knowledge Workers 3/12

Other educational Amenities provide college education, which is needed to induce office towers to grow in your city. The Community College, Technical School, Graduate School, and Hospital all provide college education, meaning Bachelor's Degrees and PhDs.

The Community College is available from the start, but other buildings will need to be unlocked. You will also unlock an opportunity to build a University. Look for the achievement "I'm Off to College!" when your city has 40,000 people, an Education Score of 20, and one Residential building of Value 7. Then build the University Quad from the ![](IconUniversityCategory)University Section [Y] of the ![](IconZoneMonoGovernment)Amenity Tool [4].

The University contains many different colleges with different benefits in addition to educating a large number of students. The University and the other colleges will attract students from outside the city, and once they graduate, they are likely to settle here and take Office jobs.
