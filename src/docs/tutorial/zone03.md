In the Zone Tool, the colorful moving bars represent the demand for each zone. You'll want to keep track of this demand by clicking ![](IconPin) to pin the Zone Demand Chart to the right side.

When the demand for ![](IconZoneResidential) Residential is zero, you'll have to build more ![](IconZoneFarm) Agricultural to employ people before new citizens will move in.

Get a population of 500 to continue. Tired of waiting for people to move in? Use ![](IconSpeedFF2) at the top to increase the game speed.
