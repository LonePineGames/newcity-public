Who Is Gonna Pay For It? 3/3

Don't try to keep a positive balance (no loan). As your city grows and inflation reduces the value of money, that loan will not so much be paid off as lost in the noise. Once you have a billion dollar budget, an eighty million dollar loan from 1950 is irrelevant.

It may seem irresponsible, but spending other people's money to expand your profit base (taxpayers) is simply taking advantage of opportunities. Yes, it is irresponsible to borrow money to pay for things that won't make a profit -- don't put a luxury car you can't afford on your credit card. But a large, rich, captive tax base can be very profitable.

Be savvy. Take the loan.
