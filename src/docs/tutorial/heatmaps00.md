Heatmaps are geographic information about various things in your city -- from Pollution to Prosperity, Crime to Community. At any given location in your city, each Heatmap has a value between 0 and 10. The most important heatmap is Density, since it determines whether you'll see tall buildings. You need a skyscraper (Density 9) to win the game.

In this tutorial, we'll cover all the heatmaps in order, explaining what they mean, what they affect, and what affects them. Let's go!
