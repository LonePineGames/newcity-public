The Transit Way 8/15

We're finally ready to start placing track! You probably want to start with a ![](IconRailPlatform)![](IconTrainSign)Station Platform [G]. Trains can only stop at a Station Platform.

Train tracks are built just like roads. Build a Station Platform, then a stretch of ![](IconRail2)Double Rail. Build another Station Platform two or three grid squares away.

It's okay to build road/rail crossings, as long as it's not a very busy road. Keep building tracks with occasional stations until you get to a dense area, where there are big buildings you don't want to tear up. Then click OK to go to the next step of this tutorial.
