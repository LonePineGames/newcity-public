Knowledge Workers 7/12

With a person selected, you will see information about who that person is and what they are doing. What is their education level? Where do they work? If there isn't a workplace listed, and it doesn't say "Unemployed" in red text, then that person isn't a worker. (Not everyone works, including children, retirees, tourists, those that stay at home to care for others, and of course lazy bums.)

Next let's take a look at a business. Use the Query Tool to select a building other than a house -- perhaps a farm, a factory or one of the shops in your retail zone.
