The Transit Way 14/15

To reduce the wait time of taking the train, open the ![](IconBus)Transit View [F10]. Headway is the amount of time between trains, and you can select the headway for daytime (6am-6pm) and night (6pm-6am). Reduce the daytime headway to 15 minutes.

To reduce the cost of taking the train, click ![](IconLeft)NewTrack to see the overview of all NewTrack lines. The default of 50 cents a ticket may seem cheap to you in the 21st century, but remember it's $formatYear(now())$ -- money used to be worth a lot more!

Make the ticket price cheaper -- maybe $0.24. You can even make the train free if you like! But keep in mind, you have to pay for your transit system. Give what your budget can afford.
