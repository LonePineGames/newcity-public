With a building selected and the "Who's Inside" tab open, you will see a business or two operating in that location. (If there are no businesses listed, pick a different building.)

Click on that business. You will see information about them. Are they a farm, factory, office, or retail? Who works there? Are they looking for new workers? Are they waiting on a freight delivery? Are they lacking customers?

(By the way, in addition to the four types of businesses, there are also Institutions. Institutions are organizations that exist to run Amenities. They employ people and have visitors, just like businesses. Query an Amenity an you'll probably see an Institution there.)
