One last thing to go over: the Education Score. In the Charts Panel, click on ![](IconServicesCategory). You will see the different scores your city has. These scores are aggregate from the amenities you build.

For example, the Library promises it'll give you +1 to Education. This is where all those +1s are totalled. Note that the Library doesn't grant any degrees -- it doesn't educate people directly -- so how does it benefit your city overall?

The Education Score determines the maximum number of people with High School or college education that wish to remain in your city. Erudite people will move out if you don't invest in education via amenities like the Library. You should try to match your High School Diploma Limit to your population. Click ![](IconPin) next to your Education Score to pin it to the right sidebar.

Now you understand everything you need to know about NewCity's education model, employment model, and how they play together. Obviously it's quite complicated, but don't get overwhelmed. Just build enough schools and your smart citizens will do the rest.
