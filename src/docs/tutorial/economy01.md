Knowledge Workers 2/12

To create a more educated workforce, you must either entice learned people to move into your city, or teach the citizens you already have. You can accomplish both by the same method -- building educational Amenities. You can see what options you have by opening the ![](IconZoneMonoGovernment)Amenity Tool [4] and selecting ![](IconEducationCategory)Education [E].

Some educational buildings, such as the School, provide High School Diplomas. Schools should be placed to cover most of the residential areas of the city. People move around, and new citizens will often already be educated, so you don't need to cover every single house. However, if you leave a large area without education, that area might stagnate and become crime-ridden.
