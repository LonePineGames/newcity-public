### ![](IconPollution)Pollution

Pollution is kinda gross. It's irritating and it gets everywhere. Track sources of air, noise, and water based pollution in your city with the Pollution Heatmap (![](IconPollution)) and squash them out to improve your citizens' quality-of-life. You can also reduce pollution by building parks.
