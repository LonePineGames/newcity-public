What about a wikilink inside a long span of text? Surely we want to handle that too. But what happens when we have a paragraph that is interrupted by a [[Link|Link]]? We'll have to plan carefully for that possibility. BTW, here's a [[lua-api|link in the middle of a sentence]] and a [[butts|link that doesn't go anywhere]].

One of NewCity's best kept secrets is the Effects tab of the Economy Panel. Open the Economy Panel by clicking on the population statusbar (![](IconPersonMan)). Then click on the Effects tab (![](IconServicesCategory)). There you'll see your city's capacity for diplomas and degrees under ![](IconEducation)Education. You might want to ![](IconPin)pin this. You can also see the limit on residential density, which is decided by your city's ![](IconBusiness)Prestige score.

Note: citizens value their time at $formatMoney(inflate(CValueOfTime))$ per hour, so they'll wait $formatDuration(1/(24*inflate(CValueOfTime)))$ to save one dollar.

#### Excerpt from [the blog:](https://lonepine.io)

We’re straying into the “games as art” territory, and I don’t have a particular interest in addressing that debate here—but for the sake of convenience we’ll assume that they are[^1]. Art is generally seen to be a reflection of the artist in some capacity. Either of their internal struggles, their thoughts and feelings, or the unique way they view the world. What do they see in a sunset that you don’t? Or in the delicate dance of vehicles weaving in and out of traffic during rush hour? There’s beauty all around us that often goes unnoticed in the hustle and bustle of daily life. Truths to be excavated from the detritus of life. Artists create art to capture experiences and emotion, bringing some of that hidden beauty and immaterial “truth” to the surface. Presenting it in a package that resonates with hundreds—if not thousands or millions—of other people. 

As long as there has been human civilization, there has been art. The desire for self-expression, for gaining new insights on the world we share, and for appreciating beauty—these are fundamental aspects of the human experience. Now we live in a world where art and science have begun to mingle in the form of videogames. The complex systems underpinning the games we play are scientifically principled structures. The visual aspects of games demand an artistic touch. But could it be said that even the algorithms and systems driving the game represent a form of art? How the designer chooses to implement these systems, what they choose to emphasize or diminish, how they choose to replicate these small slivers of reality in virtual space all stem from the fundamental aspects above. Games become a reflection of the designer’s worldview—their beliefs, hopes, and dreams. 

What does this have to do with NewCity? 

Citybuilders are fundamentally optimistic, humanistic games. The core gameplay loops incentivize growth and construction, and decentivize destruction. They reward players who provide comfort and security through the dutiful and deliberate construction of their cities. The challenges are realistic but manageable. The goal is to manipulate the virtual world in such a way that your digital citizens can thrive. Some people might play these sorts of simulation games differently, but I submit that’s a reflection of the player and not the designer. And as mentioned before, games are all about choice—the free will of the player. What would this sort of game be if you didn’t at least have the option to wreak havoc? We’re all just a few clicks away from becoming either an angel or a demon to the folks calling our fictional cities home. Without choice, there would be no game. And the choices we make speak volumes, both as players and as game designers. Games serve as windows that peer into our very hearts and souls.
