##### Purpose
With the Traffic Infoview (![](IconCar)) active, your city will be shrouded in shadow and vehicles will be highlighted by their headlights. As more vehicles congregate on stretches of road, those segments will brighten to indicate the increase in average traffic. Find the brightest spots in your city and you'll find the bottlenecks that a savvy city planner can eliminate with thoughtful infrastructure improvements.
