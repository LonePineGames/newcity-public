Roadmap Infoview

Sometimes the real obstacle to a mayor's forethought is "too much information." Cut out the clutter with the Roadmap Infoview (![](IconRoad)) and get to planning your city's future.

##### Purpose
Use the Roadmap Infoview (![](IconRoad)) to sweep anything that isn't road-related off the proverbial table. Only roads, expressways (highlighted in yellow), railways, amenities, and the faint shadows of vehicles on the road will remain, set against a gray background. The Roadmap Infoview (![](IconRoad)) is best used to plan changes to dense city centers, peering through the skyscrapers to see the circulatory system of roads at their roots.
