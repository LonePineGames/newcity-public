Zone Infoview

Sometimes, you just want to see the zones. The Zone Infoview (![](IconHouse)) dissolves your city (visually only, of course) into the roads and the lots connected to them. 

##### Purpose
Enable the Zone Infoview (![](IconHouse)) to see only your road infrastructure and associated lots. Lots will be colored according to any zoning already applied, including dezoned lots. They will also show their assigned maximum density by the height of the lot stack.
