Health Heatmap

If you haven't got your health, you haven't got anything. Keep tabs on your citizens' physical and mental well-being with the Health Heatmap (![](IconHealth)).

Citizens that spend time in unhealthy parts of the city will sometimes become sick. When sick, they will not go to work and will either visit a doctor or stay home. If they visit a doctor at a Clinic or Hospital, they will be cured and returned to regular activity.
