#### Tip of the Patch
One of NewCity's best kept secrets is the Effects tab of the Economy Panel. Open the Economy Panel by clicking on the population statusbar (![](IconPersonMan)). Then click on the Effects tab (![](IconServicesCategory)). There you'll see your city's capacity for diplomas and degrees under ![](IconEducation)Education. You might want to ![](IconPin)pin this. You can also see the limit on residential density, which is decided by your city's ![](IconBusiness)Prestige score.
