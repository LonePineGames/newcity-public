Concept: Education

Education is essential for your city's economic advancement. In order to get those towers of glass, your city must have educated citizens. Educated citizens also pay more taxes, [[heatmaps/hmValue|buy nicer homes]], and commit less crime.

Citizens can have one of four education levels: No Education, High School Diploma, Bachelor's Degree, or Doctorate (PhD). Schools and colleges in your city will randomly educate locals over time. Newcomers to the city are often already educated, depending on your [[effects/education|![](IconEducationCategory)Education score]].

Office businesses will not spwan unless there are enough college graduates to fill jobs. Similarly, factories and retail businesses will not open if there are not enough high school graduates. Farms do not require any education.

If there is high unemployment at one education level, that will discourage new residents with that education level. Also, a higher [[effects/education|![](IconEducationCategory)Education Score]] entices educated people to settle here. Colleges and the University attract large numbers of students from out of town. These students often settle here too after they graduate.

Looking at the [[heatmaps/hmEducation|![](IconEducationCategory)Education Heatmap]], green areas have large numbers of college graduates, while blue areas are mostly high school graduates. Gray areas have no education, or no one lives there.

If a [[heatmaps/hmDensity|dense area]] is gray, place a College Prep nearby. The College Prep has packs a lot of education into one building, making it ideal for dense urban cores.
