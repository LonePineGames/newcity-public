Budget Line: Assets

![](docs/images/order.png)

The total value of all the city's Amenities. Amenities are worth more over time due to inflation and [[heatmaps/hmValue|rising land value]].

Since you could sell your Amenities for $formatPercent(CBuildingSalesFactor)$ of their value, they can be used as collateral. This makes your [[budget/budgetlineofcredit|loan]] that much bigger. This allows you to build many more Amenities than you would otherwise be able to, and pay them off over time.
