Budget Line: Eminent Domain

![](docs/images/property.png)

Money spent reimbursing property owners when demolishing their buildings to make way for infrasture or amenities. Legally, the city can force any landowner to sell their property to the city, for $formatPercent(CEminentDomainFactor)$ of it's appraised value. This comes in handy when building highways.
