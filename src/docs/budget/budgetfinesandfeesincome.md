Budget Line: Fines and Fees

![](docs/images/form.png)

To pay the bills, your police and city bureaucracy can nickel and dime your citizens. This makes your police force more corrupt and therefore less effective, increasing crime. It also raises unemployment slightly.

A moderate amount of fines and fees is normal for any city. The amount of money collected is proportionate to your population (up to $formatMoney(inflate(CFinesPerPerson))$ per person per year) and number of businesses (up to $formatMoney(inflate(CFinesPerBusiness))$ per business per year), regardless of the economic situation, making Fines and Fees a stable source of income.
