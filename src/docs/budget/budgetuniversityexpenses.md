Money spent on the University. This money goes to professors, staff, learning materials such as books, grants for scientific research and repairing university buildings.

The University is a [[budget/budgettotalmandatory|Mandatory]] expense. If you reduce funding for the University, it will be less effective. If your reduce funding to zero, the University will shut down. The abandoned buildings have a negative effect on the surrounding area.
