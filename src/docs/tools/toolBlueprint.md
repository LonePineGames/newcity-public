* If creating a new blueprint, click and hold the Left Mouse Button then drag across a section of your city, clicking Left Mouse Button again when finished to create a blueprint of it.
	* Anything contained within the blue box will be added to the new blueprint.

* The actual cost to build the blueprint will update in real time (shown in the game view) to account for variances in the terrain as well as any eminent domain costs if building over existing construction.
