Amenity Tool

The Amenity Tool (![](IconZoneMonoGovernment)) adds city services and fundamental facilities.

##### How to Use
* Select the Amenity Tool (![](IconZoneMonoGovernment)) from the toolbar with the Left Mouse Button or press its associated hotkey. 
	* Select a category: Choose from (![](IconEducationCategory)) Education, (![](IconParksCategory)) Recreation, (![](IconServicesCategory)) Community, and (![](IconUniversityCategory)) University amenities.
* Use the Information Panel (![](IconI)) to determine if your city can afford the amenity; both the one-time cost to build and the yearly cost to maintain.
* Use the Left Mouse Button to place the amenity.
	* Amenities, like zones, must be placed adjacent to a road.
 
##### Notes
* Amenities are unlocked as your city grows; certain amenity categories may not be available until at least one associated amenity is unlocked.
* Adding an amenity that overwrites existing building(s) will incur the eminent domain cost(s) of the building(s) being replaced.
