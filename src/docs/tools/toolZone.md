Zone Tool

The Zone Tool (![](IconHouse)) allows you to place zones to permit your city to grow. Citizens build on zoned lots whether they're looking for a home or starting a business. 

##### How to Use
* Select the Zone Tool (![](IconHouse)) from the toolbar with the Left Mouse Button or press its associated hotkey.
	* Select a Zone Brush type to choose how you'd like to paint the zones. The Zone Brushes are located along the top of the zone tool.
		* The Edge brush (![](IconVerticalBar)) places zones all along stretches of road, while the Radius brushes (![](IconDotMedium)) paint zones using circles of varying size. The Point brush (![](IconPointer)) places single zones.
	* The Overzone toggle (![](IconOverzone)) can be turned on and off to prevent painting new zones over existing ones. 
* Choose the type of zone you'd like to place from the central part of the Zone Tool panel. The options are Residential (![](IconZoneResidential)), Mixed Use (![](IconZoneMixedUse)), Retail (![](IconZoneRetail)), Offices (![](IconZoneOffice)), Agriculture (![](IconZoneFarm)), and Industry (![](IconZoneFactory)).
	* There are also currently two unique zone types: Parks (![](IconZonePark)) and Dezoning (![](IconZoneNone)).
		* Parks function as open space preserves and provide some of the same benefits as the park amenities.
		* Dezoning removes any existing zoning for a lot so that it can be rezoned even if overzoning is disabled.
	* Bars illustrating the amount of zone demand for each type are located above the zone icons for which there can be demand. 
* Choose the desired maximum density for your zoned lots using the Density Control slider (![](IconApartment)).
	* Zones with a configured density maximum will not allow designs to build which require a higher density level. 
 
##### Notes
* Note that zone demand updates in real time and simply reflects citizens' desire to develop zones of that type. If you have many undeveloped zones of a type with high demand consider waiting to allow them time to develop before zoning more.
* You can pin the zone demand bars to the message board with the pin (![](IconPin)) for easier viewing at a glance, especially when using other tools.
