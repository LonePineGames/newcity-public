Transportation Tool

The Transportation Tool (![](IconRoad)) is where you'll build the firm foundation on which your city will thrive. This includes regular roads, expressways, and mass transit.

NewCity is a transporation simulator at heart, and much of your city's economy depends on the scalable, reliable transportation. If people can't get to work in a reasonable amount of time, they'll become unemployed, even if there are jobs available. Transportation also affects retail sales and freight.

##### How to Use the Transportation Tool
* Select the Transportation Tool (![](IconRoad)) from the toolbar with the Left Mouse Button or press its associated hotkey.
* Select the subtool you'd like to use: Build (![](IconRoad)), Add a Mass Transit System (![](IconRoute)), Cut Road (![](IconCut)), and Build Pillars (![](IconTrussBridgePillar)).
	* Note that certain subtools will have to be unlocked for new cities.
* For the Build subtool (![](IconRoad)), you will be able to choose between Roads (![](IconRoad)), Expressways (![](IconExpressway)), and Mass Transit transit lines (![](IconBus)). The Add a Transit Line option (![](IconPlus)) allows you to add a new Mass Transit system to your city. 
	* Higher volume road and expressway types will be unlocked as a new city grows.
	* When building a road or expressway, you can use the Raise Elevation (![](IconUp)) and Lower Elevation buttons (![](IconDown)) to indicate whether it should be build at ground level or otherwise. 
		* The Build Viaducts or Tunnels toggle (![](IconCauseway))/(![](IconUnderground)), when enabled, will not move the terrain to meet the road. When disabled, the terrain elevation will be modified by roads higher or lower than ground level. 
	* Grid Snapping (![](IconGrid)) can be toggled on and off to allow for fine control over road and expressway placement. 
* For the Cut subtool (![](IconCut)), simply click a node in an existing road, expressway, or railway to insert an intersection. 
* For the Build Pillars subtool, choose the type of pillar you'd like to build: Truss Bridge Pillars (![](IconTrussBridgePillar)) or Suspension Bridge Pillars (![](IconSuspensionBridgePillar)).
	* Pillars are used to allow for more control when building bridges crossing bodies of water or elevated roadways throughout the city. 

##### Notes
* Adding or editing a Mass Transit system opens the Transit Panel, which allows you to modify ticket and transfer prices, change the color of or delete specific transit lines, and shutdown the line if needed. 
	* When adding a new Mass Transit system, the Mass Transit system designer will open, allowing you to choose the specifics of the new system including what type it is, how it is powered and controlled, and more. 
* Mass Transit stops must be added along existing roads or railways.
