* Unemployment is reduced by a percentage.
> There are multiple "percents" here, which may be confusing. ![](IconZoneMonoOffice)Business reduces unemployment from what it would be otherwise. So if you would have a 10% unemployment rate (due to economic and taxation factors), and ![](IconZoneMonoOffice)Business reduces your unemployment by 50%, you will have a 5% unemployment rate. See the [[concepts/unemployment|article on unemployment]] for more details about how unemployment works.
