Every society has it's wrongdoers, and so we need the police to protect lawful citizens. (At least, that's the theory.)

![](IconCrime)Law is a local area effect. It mitigates [[heatmaps/hmCrime|![](IconCrime)Crime]].

##### Benefits of ![](IconCrime)Law
* ![](IconCrime)Law directly influences the Crime heatmap. See the article on the [[heatmaps/hmCrime|![](IconCrime)Crime heatmap]].
* The Casino Resort and some other Amenities have a negative ![](IconCrime)Law score, meaning they actually attract a criminal element. You should place police buildings nearby to keep the crime levels down.
* The [[effects/order|![](IconZoneMonoGovernment)Order Score]] makes ![](IconCrime)Law more effective. Due to $cityName()$'s +$formatInt(amenityEffectScore(OrderScore))$ ![](IconZoneMonoGovernment)Order, Law is $formatPercent(amenityEffectMultiplier(OrderScore))$ as effective.
* [[budget/budgetfinesandfeesincome|Fines and Fees]] make your police less effective.
