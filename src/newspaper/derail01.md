The sound of twisting steel. A spectacular bang. A rising cloud of dust. These were the recollections of the citizens of quiet Mumford, when six cars from the 6am NewTrack train derailed yesterday. Miraculously, no one was injured.

NewTrack officials have promised a full investigation. The safety of the nation's rails has been in question for years, and now fear has turned to tragedy. It's not clear what this will mean for the future of passenger rail in our country.
