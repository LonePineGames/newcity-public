The notorious gangster Joe O'Leary, known to many as simply "Boss Joe", was finally arrested yesterday, but was immediately released. Lawyers for the famous criminal were able to exploit a technicality, and the state prosecutor was not able to charge Boss Joe with any crimes. He was released the same day.

It is known that O'Leary is behind the death of $randomName()$ last year, and the prosecutor's office wants to bring him to justice as soon as possible.
