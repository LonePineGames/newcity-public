Businesses Flee Farms in $cityName()$, Industry on the Rise?

Fields lie fallow and farmhouses stand empty in $cityName()$ despite the prevalence of farmland for aspiring farmers. Are the winds of industry blowing through the city streets?

Said one farmer: "I simply don't have enough demand for my goods, I can't afford to stay in business here."  

Perhaps it's time to turn an eye to bolstering $cityName()$'s industrial sector to fill the need for goods, or perhaps there simply aren't enough retail locations to go around.
