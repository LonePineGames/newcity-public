$cityName()$ University Expands!

If you're driving around campus, you might notice some changes. $cityName()$ University grew recently by $formatInt(delta(StatNumUniBuildings, OneDay))$ building$selectIf(delta(StatNumUniBuildings, OneDay)>1,"s","")$. University staff applaud the decision to invest in education.

But not everyone is thrilled. Who paid for the construction? Why, the taxpayer. The city has already spent $formatMoney(get(StatUniversityExpensesStat))$ on the university this year. "I mean, when's it going to stop?" asks $randomMansName()$, a local plumber, "There ain't no college when I was growing up."

Still, many hope that the expanded colleges will educate future taxpayers and fuel unprecedented growth in $cityName()$.
