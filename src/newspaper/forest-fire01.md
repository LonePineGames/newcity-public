Three hundred acres of forest are ablaze in the East Mountains. The fire has killed four, forced hundreds from their homes, and show no sign of stopping. It is believed that the fire was started by careless campers, and has been burning for four days. Elite fire-fighting crews are working around the clock to defeat the blaze.
