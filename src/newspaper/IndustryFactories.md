Factory Production Slows Down Across the Board

Local industries announced today they are experiencing a slowdown in demand caused by a shift of production abroad. The three largest local industrial companies began massive layoffs in an effort to reduce costs. While the factories are only a portion of this city's economy, there will be a large increase in joblessness. And the industrial areas of the city will need to be repurposed for other activities, such as offices,  retail, or parks and residential.

Frank O. Pinion, Chairman of the local Maufacturerâ€™s Association says "Cutting production and employees is the best way to save money; every company is doing it!"

The mayor is looking at options to reset several areas of the city and rebuild these as new destinations for consumers and residents. The mayor is also considering adding a new community college and technical college to educate citizens who are unemployed.
