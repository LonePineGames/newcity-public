Milton M. Margin: "Talk of Impending Recession Exaggerated."

From the desk of Milton M. Margin:

Do you smell the anxiety in the air? You may have heard rumors that long-haul truckers are seeing reduced traffic. Or you may have heard hushed whispers of an "inverted yield curve", whatever that means. If you have your retirement savings in the NSMI, you may be wondering if that should be converted to cash, lest you be the sucker.

But fear not! These old saws of economic lore are no match to the Margin Model, the most reliable predictor of the financial weathers. My advanced, calculus based system can reliably portend the future of the NSMI. And my model says "Up, Up, Up!"

I believe we will see a minimum of 4 more years of growth before the next NSMI downturn. In fact, stock market crashes may be a thing of the past, due to new technology and our stable economic governance. So keep buying!
