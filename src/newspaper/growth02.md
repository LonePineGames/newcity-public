Population Surges in $cityName()$

Hats off to the mayor, who has made $cityName()$ an incredibly attractive locale for citizens searching for a place to put down roots and call home. 

Thanks to the mayor's deft management style the population has grown to $formatInt(get(StatPopulation))$ with even more growth projected in the years to come.

A. Young, a local citizen, stated in a letter to the editor this month: "I couldn't believe my eyes, the city looks like ten million fireflies. A real metropolis. Yet it still feels like the a small, tight-knit community I fell in love with. Great job, mayor."

Thank you indeed, mayor--and keep up the good work!
