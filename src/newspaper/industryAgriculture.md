According to the NMSI, hog belly futures have dropped over 30 percent in value over the last three months. This is caused by a glut in the Weekly Butt Primal Market according to Butch R. Schweinefleisch, an NMSI commodities trader. Local farmers increased production of hogs to combat a shortage many years ago. Corn and feed production also increased to meet the demand. Today, there is excess global supply as many farmers from all parts of the world ramp up hog production. The local agriculture community is in dire economic straits as farmers are forced to slaughter pigs to avoid more losses.

Owen Lotsacash, trader on the NMSI futures exchange says "Time to cut the losses and sell pork belly futures."

The mayor is considering ways to support agriculture including converting farms to residential use, and shifting farm production to other agriculture products.
