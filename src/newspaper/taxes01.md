Are High Taxes Stifling Growth in $cityName()$?

$randomWomansName()$ works hard for her family. "Ten hour days, plus taking care of the kids. I don't do it to take care of the city's treasury." She's part of a growing movement of citizens fed up with the high property tax rate in $cityName()$.

But it's not just pissed off homeowners. The high tax rate might actually be impeding the city's growth target. With $formatPercent(growth(StatPopulation, OneYear))$ growth over the last year, many speculate that our property tax rate of $formatPercent(get(StatPropertyTaxRateStat))$ makes $cityName()$ a less attractive place to move.

"I still love it here," reports $randomWomansName()$, "but I'll be honest, I wouldn't move here."
