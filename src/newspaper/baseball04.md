The $team2$ took a first-inning lead against The $team1$, as expected given how strong a showing we've seen from The $team2$ this season. Bets were running 10-1 against The $team1$, but the underdogs made a surprise comeback, beating the home team in later innings. We might have an unexpected contestant for the championships.
