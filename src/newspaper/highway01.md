![](newspaper/images/highway01.png)

The city has just built $formatMoney(sum(StatExpwyBuildExpensesStat, OneDay))$ of new expressway. The new expansion eases the burden of traffic and will bring economic development to the suburbs. The city's economist says we will see new stores, office towers, and high paying jobs, all thanks to better roads.

Does this mean wider lanes, new onramps and offramps, or even a new or refurbished interchange? Dear reader, you'll have to explore the new road system for yourself and see. [[infoviews/ivRoadmap|Turn to page 4]] to see a detailed map of the improvements.
