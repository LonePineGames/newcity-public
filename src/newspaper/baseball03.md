For 7 innings, neither team could score a run. Both teams showed excellence in the outfield, and neither was strong enough on the plate to get on base. Finally after the 7th inning stretch, The $team1$ scored a run. The $team2$ held them back as long as they could, but as the game almost went into extra innings, a victor was finally confirmed in the bottom of the 9th. The $team1$ will go on to face The $randomTeam()$ next.
