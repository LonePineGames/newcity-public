The $team1$ took a first-inning lead against The $team2$, a lead which they never relinquished. The $team2$ played extremely good defense, but were weak at bat, and the home team was consistently ahead on runs. The $team2$ still have a shot at the championships if they beat The $randomTeam()$ next week.
