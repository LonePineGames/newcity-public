Prices Soar Across the Board!

![](Chart::StatInflationIndex:NationalEcon)

The inflationary spiral caused by a change in the value of our currency has raised the prices of most goods. Bread is up 25 percent, clothes and shoes are up 30 percent, and a movie ticket will cost about half of a citizen's paycheck.

Everyone is feeling the pinch of higher prices. "Daddy, why is money worthless now?" asks 8 year old Mary Zellebration to her father, Hardy.

"We don't control it, but we can spend our money more frugally!" he answered.

Citizens in our city are already cutting back on discretionary expenses, such as expensive dinners, gifts and unnecessary household items. This is causing a slow down in the local economy.

The Mayor is planning to encourage our citizens to stay active and sustain the economic health of our community. Perhaps more support in the form of new parks would help. Or upgraded schools and colleges to increase the skills of our citizens would increase per capita income.
