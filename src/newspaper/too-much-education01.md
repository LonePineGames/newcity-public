A Detailed Explaination of the Four Color Map Theorem and it's Recent Computer Proof

![](newspaper/images/fourcolormap.png)

Recently the math department at $cityName()$ University was recognized in the national news for their great success in proving the Four Color Map Theorem using a computer. As I'm sure it's obvious to the reader, given any separation of a plane into contiguous regions, the regions can be colored using at most four colors so that no two adjacent regions have the same color -- and we now have the proof.

But our learned readership wants to know, how did they do it? Why was a computer necessary? "And can we ever trust a proof that requires such a large number of cases that it would be infeasable to check by hand?" asks $randomName()$, a professor at Capitol City University. (Boo!)

$cityName()$, a city which now holds the highest rate of PhD educated humans in the nation at $formatPercent(get(StatPhdEduPercent))$, is now additionally famous for our computer proof, settling the question of the four color map once and forever. You can find a detailed explaination of the proof, as well as the accompanying whitepaper printed in full, in the _Science and Nature Section_ which starts on page 76.
