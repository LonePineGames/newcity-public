New Study: Sandwiches Cut Diagonally Only 30% Better

We all remember when, a few years back, scientists announced triumphantly that sandwiches cut diagonally were 45% better than sandwiches cut cross-ways. Of course, no 5 year old ever needed a scientific whitepaper -- the benefit is obvious to anyone that's ever eaten a PB&J. But now a new study indicates that "highly scientific" 45% figure might have been a slight exaggeration.

The original study failed to account for the shape of the bread involved, and this is the crust of the issue. The new study, which evaluated several different types of sandwiches including egg salad and open face styles, concluded that diagonal cuts only give a 30% benefit.

If slices of bread were perfect squares, then a 45% benefit would apply. But all brands of bread sold today use a 2-to-1 "aspect ratio", meaning the ratio between the long side of the piece and the short side. Due to the angles and geometry involved, the benefit of diagonal cuts was cut down by a third.

The new study also concurred with previous research indicating that uncut sandwiches are terrible.
