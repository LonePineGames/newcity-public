$formatInt(get(StatPopulation))$ People Live Here!

$cityName()$ has experienced amazing growth over the last year. We went from $formatInt(getPast(StatPopulation, OneYear))$ to over $formatInt(get(StatPopulation))$, a growth rate of $formatPercent(growth(StatPopulation, OneYear))$. Amazing.

And our home will continue to grow, just as long as there are plenty of jobs to be filled, and just as long as the city continues to [[tools/toolZone|build new residential areas]] for people to live. Here's to another great year!
