Owning a new sports car is all the rage amongst a new generation of buyers.

Bea Faster, Director of Public Relations for The BTG Sports Car Company, says "Auto sales are up 12 percent and BTG sales are up 18 percent. Better speed over to your dealer and cruise away with your new sports car!"

The craze is affecting young and old alike. In our city we are seeing many new sports cars parked at restaurants, theaters and entertainment venues. Times are good for our citizens.

The mayor needs to keep building the city, including amenities, schools, retail and offices.
