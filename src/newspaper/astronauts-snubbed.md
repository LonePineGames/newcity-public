$cityName()$ Fails NSSA Physical Exam

![Would-be Astronaut $randomName()$, a $cityName()$ resident, failing part of the exam.](newspaper/images/astronauts02.png)

For the last year, NSSA (the National Space Ship Administration) has been touring the nation, with stops in every major city. They set out to find fit men and women -- the best of the best -- to be the next generation of astronauts. Anyone 18-45 in good health was encouraged to apply.

NSSA just released their initial roster of new cadets, and it includes zero -- that's right ZERO -- $cityName()$ residents! No dreams of the stars for us! It looks like $cityName()$ is stuck here in the mud until we can get our bodies in shape.

Mayor, please build more healthcare! Some places where we can play sports would go a long way too.
