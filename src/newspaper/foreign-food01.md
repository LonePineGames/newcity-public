Citizens of $cityName()$ Lament Lack of Quality Foreign Food

It's hard to find a restaurant in $cityName()$ that isn't serving the usual fare. And for those that are, the results are simply subpar--at least, according to local H. Manning. Our reporter found Mr. Manning outside of a local Asian eatery, where he was shouting while resisting arrest about simply wishing to enjoy "a succulent Asian meal" and deriding the manifest democracy which sought to arrest him instead of correct this tragedy of cuisine. 

This started our reporter on an investigation, to discover whether in fact our city was suffering from a simple palate. Upon performing an exit interview outside a local fast food chain which proclaimed to peddle flavors from south of the border, the patron said: "When you order carne asada and get a taco filled with ground beef, you know you have a problem."

The $cityName()$ city council is preparing to hold a hearing for possible solutions this coming week.
