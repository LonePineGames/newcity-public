Historic Stock Market Crash Leads to Record Canned Goods Sales

It's been a tough year for most of the country, but some have actually seen their stock improve as the rest of us struggle. Yerna Canneries, Inc, is the nation's primary manufacturer of canned tuna, peaches, corn, green beans, and other foods. The company has seen record growth over the last quarter.

"We've actually opened factories in buildings where other industries are moving out," reports $randomName()$, the CEO of Yerna Canneries. In a time of market instablity, an uncertain job market, and an unclear future, the long shelf life and low cost of canned foods are driving shoppers to buy in huge amounts.

If you have been shopping in the last few months, you might have seen the barren shelves as the last canned items are snatched up. With new factories, Yerna promises that last month's severe shortage, of canned peaches and other items, will not return. "We have a commitment to the people of our nation to keep the shelves stocked," said the CEO.
