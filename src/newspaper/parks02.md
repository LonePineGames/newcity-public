$cityName()$ a Green Scene, Thanks to Mayor's Efforts

Worried that $cityName()$ was becoming a pavement paradise? An urban jungle? Worry no more, thanks to the mayor's new initiative to paint the town green with grass and foliage. 

It seems as if new parks are springing from the fertile soil on a daily basis. One resident was even quoted as saying: "There can in fact be too much of a good thing. But I don't think we've reached that limit yet with all the top-tier parks and recreation facilities in $cityName()$. Thanks mayor!"

In other news, sightings of squirrels, salamanders, and skunks have skyrocketed--proving that where flora flourishes, fauna abounds. When we asked the same resident for comment, he simply stated: "I could do without the skunks."
