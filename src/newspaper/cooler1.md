Dress Designs Now Need to be 47% Cooler, Due to Inflation

Fashion designers are under a lot of pressure these days. They used to be able to leave work early on Fridays, just as long as they met that "20% cooler" target. But inflation, combined with increased competition from overseas, has changed the game, and trend-setters find themselves in the studio rather than the club most Fridays.

"I've been in this business for 40 years," said Shanti Brixbi, who is a four-decade veteran of the fashion industry. "I used to scoff at designers who submitted 15% cooler designs, but I never expected the styles to change so radically. I've been making dresses for decades, but now when I manage to draft designs that are 40%, even 45% cooler, it's still not enough, even for fast fashion." Brixbi has been a fashion designer for four tenths of a century.

Fourty seven percent cooler is the new standard just to appear on the racks. To get nominated for the highest awards shows, designers must now achieve the coveted "60% cooler" mark. It's not clear how much longer this can continue. Most physicists believe that dresses cannot be made more than 88% cooler, at least without risks to the wearer's health.

Of course, not everyone believes that 88% is the limit. "Coolness has always increased on an exponential curve, going back to the earliest records of 16th century French fashion," reports design futurist Clay Coolzweil, "The end of coolness has long been predicted, but we have no idea what new design technologies will come out in the next decades."

So what happens when and if dress designs reach the physical limits of coolness? No one knows for sure, but Brixbi, a fashion designer for fourty years, remarks darkly, "I guess I'll have to get a job in marketing."
