Unemployment Plummets amid Strong Job Market

$randomBusinessName()$ has been looking for a new salesperson -- for the past 2 years. "We just can't find anyone," said $randomName()$, a manager at the firm. And they're not alone. Businesses across $cityName()$ report that they struggle to find workers to fill the $formatInt(get(StatNumOpenPositions))$ job openings citywide.

With our unemployment rate at just $formatPercent(get(StatUnemploymentRate))$, new workers will have to come from elsewhere. But will the city build new [[tools/toolBlueprint|residential subdivisions]] for all the new workers? And what will that population growth do to our transportation system? Only time will tell.
