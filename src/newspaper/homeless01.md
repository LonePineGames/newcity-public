###### Downtowners Complain of Homeless Tents, Unsanitary Conditions and Debris.

A year ago, $randomMansName()$ was doing well. He had a job, an apartment, and a car. How quickly life can turn. "This tent is all I have now," he says.

High rent costs, lack of jobs and poor community support have left some $cityName()$ dwellers without a place to stay. "This affects everyone, not just the unhoused," comments Sister $randomWomansName()$, "When people sleep on the streets, there is more crime, more health risks and a host of other problems. And people are empathetic -- no one likes to see a fellow in the gutter."

The mayor is considering building more [[concepts/homeless|public and social housing]], a cheap option that will ultimately save the city money on policing and healthcare. The sisters look forward to the day when every resident of $cityName()$ has a home.
