Officer $randomMansName()$ has been arresting criminals for 10 years. In a strange turn of events, he was arrested himself yesterday. The officer is accused of multiple counts of accepting bribes, along with other corruption.

"There's a culture of corruption in our police force," investigator $randomWomansName()$ says. "Our police have become dependant on fines and fees. It's policing for profit." She claims that decisions from the top have driven this corrupt institutional culture. "This goes all the way to the mayor's office."
