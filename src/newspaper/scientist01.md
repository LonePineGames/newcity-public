Local Scientist Discovers Key to Time Travel

In an unassuming suburban home here in $cityName()$, one self-professed scientist has purportedly broken the bonds that hold us tethered to the present. While gesticulating at a modified 1980s sports car, the man rambled about phenomenal amounts of electricity and needing to maintain slightly higher than highway speeds for a time to return to the past. While no demonstration of this technology was forthcoming due to what the man claimed were "terroristic threats," he has recruited the help of a local youth in filming the inaugural voyage of his supposed time machine.

When asked for a final quote in layman's terms to end the interview on, the man simply exclaimed "Great Scott!" and scurried away.
