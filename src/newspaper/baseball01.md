A stunning blow out as The $team1$ deny The $team2$ any opportunity to make a run. The $team1$ played extremely good defense, while still being strong at bat, and the $team2$ were simply wiped out. The $team2$ will have to wait until next year to regain their glory. The $team1$ go on to play The $randomTeam()$.
