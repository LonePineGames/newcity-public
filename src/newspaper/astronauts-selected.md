For the last year, NSSA (the National Space Ship Administration) has been touring the nation, with stops in every major city. They set out to find fit men and women - the best of the best - to be the next generation of astronauts. Anyone 18-45 in good health was encouraged to apply.

NSSA just released their initial roster of new cadets, and it includes many of our fellow $cityName()$ residents! So congratulations to all selectees. We hope you remember $cityName()$ when you're looking down on us from space.

$cityName()$ placed second nationwide in number of selected candidates, after West Valley City. This has been attributed to the city's great physical fitness. We're blessed to have such an efficient health care system in $cityName()$. And we have many sports fields which make it so easy to stay in shape here. Thank you mayor! Good health is always worth it!
