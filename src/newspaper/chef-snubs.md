"There's no good food there."

###### Chef snubs $cityName()$.

Internationally famous chef $randomMansName()$ visted $cityName()$ last week. Planning to visit fine restaurants, he was severely disappointed. He even cut his trip short, commenting, "I can't eat this trash. I'll starve here."

$cityName()$ has become known as a cultureless wasteland. For a city our size, the lack of arts, entertainment and fine dining is notable. It seems we will not be a [[effects/prestige|destination for the rich and famous]].

We asked the chef if he'd enliven our culture and open a restaurant here. "No chance," he replied, "I wouldn't be caught dead in this city."
