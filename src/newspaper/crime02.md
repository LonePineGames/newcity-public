The notorious gangster Joe O'Leary, known to many as simply "Boss Joe", remains at large today. The police prepared an elaborate sting operation to capture the famous criminal, but Boss Joe was tipped off and fled justice yesterday. City officials speculate that there may be a mole, or double agent, working in police operations. Boss Joe is wanted for murder, racketeering, and tax evasion.
