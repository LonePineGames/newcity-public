Release of Three Million Party Balloons Results in No Negative Consequences Whatsoever

$randomWomansName()$, a teacher and active member of the community of Cheeseberg, wanted to organize a fun event for the children and families of her city. "It was just a joy of a time," she said afterwards, "and an opportunity to set a world record. I hope people remember Cheeseberg as the city that released an enormous number of party balloons for no reason."

Last Saturday, thousands of people came together in a downtown Cheeseberg parking lot. Over 14 hours, they filled hundreds of thousands of balloons with helium. "I got three blisters working so hard," said $randomWomansName()$, a fifth grader and balloon enthusiast.

The balloons collected in a giant mesh which had been set up the night before. When the count passed three million, the mesh was cut and the balloons were set free to float through the air. "It's beautiful!" exclaimed $randomMansName()$, "The giant cloud of multicolor balloons does not in any way look garish or ridiculous."

The millions of balloons did not interfere with any aircraft or birds in flight, and as they fell back to Earth, they did not pollute waterways or litter the roads and countryside. We don't know where the balloons went, so there is no danger to fish or wildlife. It was a wonderful experience for everyone involved and in no way was a disaster.
