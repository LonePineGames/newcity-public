Milton M. Margin: "The Return of Stability"

From the desk of Milton M. Margin:

The economy has been a wild ride these past months. Stagnation in the $selectRandom("Agricultural", "Financial", "Utility", "Mining", "Technology", "Banking", "Manufacturing", "Automotive")$ industry led to bankruptcies, then a national crisis. International trade seized up, and many feared the worst.

But the worst is over dear friends! The Margin Model, the most reliable predictor of our nation's financial futures, has good news for us again. My model predicts a $formatPercent(randomFloat(0.05, 0.30))$ rise in the NSMI over the next year, and similar GDP growth.

What does that mean? More jobs, for one thing. Our unemployment rate will turn around, from the $formatInt(100*get(StatUnemploymentRate, NationalEcon))$% it is now to less than half that. $selectIf(delta(StatUnemploymentRate, OneDay, NationalEcon) > 0, "National unemployment rose this quarter, but that will change soon, my friends.", "The national unemployment was at " .. formatInt(100*getPast(StatUnemploymentRate, OneDay, NationalEcon)) .. "% last quarter, so we are already seeing the recovery.")$
