No New Shops in $cityName()$

A new report indicates that $cityName()$'s retail sector didn't grow at all last year. Not a single new restaurant was opened, and new store openings didn't manage to keep up with the constant cycle of store closings.

"The mayor has made it clear. $cityName()$ is not the place to do business," rages $randomMansName()$, the owner of a local pet shop. "I don't see how anyone can make a profit with sales taxes what they are."

Currently the city charges a tax of $formatInt(get(StatSalesTaxRateStat)*100)$ cents for every dollar spent in a retail establishment. That might not seem like a lot, but for a business operating on thin margins, that can break the bank.

Citizens will drive out of town if they can't buy what they need within the city limits. Those that don't own a car will suffer the most. It's not clear what this means for the future of $cityName()$, but it won't be pretty.
