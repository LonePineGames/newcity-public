Average Citizens of Kodella took to the streets yesterday to protest the corrupt government of General Santollo. "Down with Santollo! Democracy for the people!" was the cry of many in Kodella's capitol city on The Sandgold Coast. International observers have been warning about the brutal response of the state police to the riots, with accusations that the general-dictator has used chemical weapons on his citizens.
