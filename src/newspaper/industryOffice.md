Tech Growth is Over! Office Space Vacant

Years ago, a race to take advantage of the emerging tech advances broke out. $randomMansName()$ was quoted saying, "Technology is radically changing the way we live, work and play. That means big profits for first movers."

However, as the race slows down, the city has seen a significant drop in business and employment for many in the industry. Specifically, local industrious companies have canceled options on new and existing office space after drastically cut employment. Driving down the road, there seems to be little activity within these businesses, if any at all.

Les Trouble of Trouble Brothers Commercial Realty says "Available office space is ten times the normal rate. But, no one is leasing new space now. So the buildings will stay dark for a while!"

The mayor is considering several options including funding new development for the next wave of technology and repurposing these buildings for tourism, residential or even a library.
