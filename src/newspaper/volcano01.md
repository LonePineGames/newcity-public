Citizens of the $selectRandom("North","South","East","West")$ Isles were awakened yesterday at 4am local time to a low rumbling. When they ventured outside in the twilight, hot ash and rock rained down on them. The skies of the northern hemisphere were darkened and the entire island chain was quickly evacuated. At least $formatInt(randomInt(20,300))$ people are dead, a number that continues to climb.
