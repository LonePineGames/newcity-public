Standardized Tests Adjusted for Graduating Class: "They are Dumb as Rocks"

![](newspaper/images/abandoned03.png)

As a result of low test scores, Superintendent $randomName()$ issued an emergency proclamation this week to lower the standard for testing across $cityName()$. The new testing system called PASS (Please Assess Students Superiority) will be immediately made available in all schools, libraries, and public bathrooms.

The new system is very straightforward; simply writing your name in will guarantee a passing grade, and extra credit is awarded if you thank the test proctor before leaving the test site. Schoolchildren are divided on the new rules. $randomName()$, a second grader, seemed confused; "Who are you and what is a 'spamdardized test'?"
