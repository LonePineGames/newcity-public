Local Deskjocky Endures $formatInt(get(StatAverageTripTime)*24*1.5)$ Hour Commute

Trouble making it to work on time? You're not alone. $cityName()$ is known for grueling commutes, but it's gotten even worse recently. Take it from $randomWomansName()$, a local sales manager. "I do it for family," she says, "I'm putting my first daughter through college." She spends $formatInt(get(StatAverageTripTime)*24*1.5)$ hours driving to work, and the same time driving home. How is that possible?

To make the commute tolerable, her employer, $randomBusinessName()$, allows employees to work 12 hour shifts on alternating days. This unusual arrangement has made life somewhat tolerable in $cityName()$, but it's not good for business. In addition to pollution, stress, and health consequences, the [[transportation|traffic]] is strangling our economy.

With average commutes extending to $formatInt(get(StatAverageTripTime)*24)$ hours, many workers are simply not showing up to work at all. Even though there are $formatInt(get(StatNumOpenPositions))$ unfilled positions at businesses across $cityName()$, there's no sense applying for a job if you're going to spend all day driving -- and still show up late. Therefore, our unemployment rate of $formatPercent(get(StatUnemploymentRate))$ is no mystery.

And how is the unemployed life? $randomName()$ doesn't find it so bad. "I'd rather watch TV than watch traffic."
