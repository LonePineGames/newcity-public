So zones are free... when I was a kid playing sc2000 I thought "its BS that zones cost money, from the city's perspective it's just an administrative thing"
That means that the primary expense of growing the city is building roads. The goal is that as the city grows, you need higher-tier roads, eventually ending in expressways, that are super expensive
But there are also significant recurring expenses, repairing roads and government services, which means parks, schools, police stations, etc
The government services and their effects was the most recently implemented, least fleshed out part
But basically, if you place parks and schools you get more taxes, and schools also means factories. The farmland is actually burdensome because it takes up so much space, so you'll want to transition into factories as soon as the game will let you
Later game, you'll want to transition into offices and less-polluting industries (Tech in the game)... in order to do so, you'll have to pay for a lot of government services, it'll be quite expensive
I also want to implement random periods of ~one year of recessions, where there is no growth, some businesses will close up, you'll have more problems with poverty, and your budget will be more strained
So I guess that's your disaster system haha
J-Sleezy21Today at 4:43 PM
If you think about it...that is pretty damn disastrous
lone-pineToday at 4:45 PM
Usually with sim games you are either in a unrecoverable situation (massive debt and a failed city) or you have so much money that it doesn't matter... I want a more dynamic situation, where you can be in crisis, do your best to weather it, and then grow again later
oh also you'll have less "Line of Credit" during recessions
The game giveth and the game taketh away
LOC is kinda the financial lifeblood of the city, since it shouldn't be possible to not be in debt until the late game, ideally.
J-Sleezy21Today at 4:47 PM
That makes sense
lone-pineToday at 4:48 PM
LOC is a substitute for having to manually manage loans ... rather than committing to loans of a certain size, you just spend until the bank won't give you more
interest is also a significant expense
