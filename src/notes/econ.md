The goal of New Cities is to create a large city with one or more dense city centers. You build roads, buildings spawn along those roads, you provide government services, and you try to get the best buildings you can - high density, high value buildings. You win when you succesfully spawn a Skyscraper - the highest Density, highest Value commercial (mixed use) building.

As your city grows, you face four main challenges. The first is Traffic - a large city is tough to travel across, and people will not visit shops that are too far and will lose their jobs if their commute is too long. The road and zone structure of your city determines if every neighborhood can survive. High Traffic also causes Pollution. Later, you get access to Expressways, which can mitigate a lot of Traffic issues.

The second challenge is economic growth. In order to have more than farms, houses, and strip malls, you need to create the conditions for a good economy - specifically schools. Once you have Education and Prosperity, Density is possible.
