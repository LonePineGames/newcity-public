Bionic Eyes Restore 7 Year Old's Sight

When the Phillis-Tarman Virus revaged Shelly Ackerman's kindergarten class, most of her classmates recovered with no serious effects. Poor Shelly was not as lucky. She was left completely blind. But then a miracle of medical science saved her from a life of darkness.

Bionic implants have become common for adults, especially those working in dangerous industries, as well as the bio-punks you might see hanging around in seedy clubs. But it's still unusual for a child to have implements installed. Shelly is the youngest person ever in $cityName()$ to get ocular implants.

Engineers designed a special modular implant just for Shelly. The modules can be swapped out for larger ones as her biological body grows, and she even got a special X-Ray vision module. She might be the lucky one after all! "But we told her it would be taken away if she uses her ability to see through walls for anything naughty," her father said.
