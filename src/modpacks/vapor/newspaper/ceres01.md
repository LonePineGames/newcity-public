#### Earth has lost the key to the belt.

At 0300 our time, Martian frigates appeared suddenly on radar scanners placed on asteroids near Ceres. Mars is currently only 1 minute of time delay away from Ceres in their orbits, whereas today Earth is almost 40 light minutes away from both. Therefore Mars Remote Fleet Command had a decisive advantage over Terrain defenses. Before anyone here on Earth knew what was happening, the miners on Ceres had already surrendered.

If Earth is not able to counter and the Martians take total control of the belt, Mars is expected to cease shipments of platinum from the belt. Platinum is critical in modern electronics, bionics, and robots.

"We are immedietly responding to this impending crisis by reopening the abandoned platinum mines on Earth, which were built before the industrialization of the belt," says ResourceCo CEO and world president Guyus Freeman, "Unfortunately we will have to return to the era of Earth-based mining to win the war."
